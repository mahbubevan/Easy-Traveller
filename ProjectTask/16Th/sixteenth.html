  <br>Visit India and you’re catapulted straight into a chameleonic theater of color. Even the glorious<br>
  old architecture is vividly draped, from the sun reflecting off the Taj Mahal to the pink regal <br>
  city of Jaipur. This is the dazzling backdrop, the delightful exterior that hangs over a population<br>
  delighting in bringing vitality and vibrancy to everything. Just being outside is a sensual<br>
  banquet; fresh smells float and flicker, merging with sounds of soft temple bells and the shouts<br>
  of chai wallahs. Then a painted elephant walks past and a market stall reveals a thousand <br>
  flamboyant saris. Trying to describe this experience to friends verges on the impossible: <br>
  “well, err, it was, it was so…India!”<br>

 <br>India is a huge country, home to over one billion people and 29 individual states, each remarkably<br>
 different from the last. It would take years to see it all, and even longer to understand it.<br>
 On one hand it remains a poor nation, yet the blossoming economy is helping to power a sophisticated<br>
 tourism market. Gone are the days when visiting India meant having to rough it. Five-star hotels<br>
 are decorated with inimitable style and panache, a network of tourist-tailored domestic flights<br>
 dramatically reduces travel time, and the government is feverishly investing in positioning India<br>
 as an upmarket travel destination. Grandeur should be expected, after all, India has been offering<br>
 aristocratic opulence since long before the nation was conceived. It’s now safe to shed the old<br>
 stereotypes and pamper yourself on this new commitment to luxury.<br>

 <br>However, the country’s heart remains indelibly humble, and its soul invariably welcoming.<br>
 Wandering the streets reveals one of India’s many faces; every soiree outside is imbued with a <br>
 radiant hypnotism. Yet India supplements this omnipresent charm with an outstanding collection <br>
 of attractions and paradigms. Spiritual cities submerge you in mesmeric culture, always ensuring <br>
 immersive experiences with local people and lifestyles. Richly diverse landscapes provide a<br>
 stage to explore, from the Himalayan Mountains to the beaches of Goa, and from the endlessly<br>
 green tea plantations to deserts and salt pans crossed by camels. Charming ancient cities cover<br>
 the country, each absolutely unique and serving up wondrous temples, shimmering forts, and a<br>
 sublime blend of architectural styles. Like Hindu god Brahma, there are so many faces to discover.<br>
 Go trekking, ride elephants, practice yoga, watch birds, meet holy babas, track tigers, meditate,<br>
 indulge, experience, and jump in to the most enchanting show on our planet. The following is <br>
 just a glimpse at the country’s iconicism.<br>
  
 <br><b>1.The Colored Cities of Rajasthan: </b>Rajasthan revels in its ambiance of ancient glory,<br>
 infusing the architectural wonders with endless slices of cultural heritage. Rugged forts and<br>
 spectacular palaces grab the attention revealing relics from centuries of warrior narratives and <br>
 regal prosperity. Each city has its own style and color; Jaipur is the “Pink City,” Jodhpur the<br>
 blue one, Udaipur the “City of Lakes,” and Jaisalmer is the scorched red gateway to the Thar <br>
 Desert. Nestled between these iconic destinations are mountain retreats, camel market towns, <br>
 elephant tours, dance troupes, and a continual immersion in eminent wonder.<br>
 <br><b>2.India’s Sacred Cities and Spirituality:</b>Temple bells chime and spirituality exudes<br>
 from most Indian streets, the engrossing experience elevated in the country’s holy cities along<br>
 the River Ganges. Varanasi is the oldest and most riveting, the centerpiece of Hindu culture <br>
 where smoke infused ceremonies are performed by babas, and dead bodies are symbolically burnt<br>
 at the entrance to the river. It’s India in a nutshell, a labyrinth of enchanting smells, colors,<br>
 sounds, and monkeys that swing around the rooftops. Less intense yet equally captivating, <br>
 you’ll find a myriad of important Hindu towns along the irrefutable Ganga and further afield.<br>
  
 <br><b>3.The Taj Mahal and Ancient Agra:</b>Few buildings ignite the imagination like the Taj Mahal,<br>
 the white marble mausoleum built by a Mughal emperor for his wife. As the sun crosses the sky<br>
 it brings subtle shades and wizardry reflections to the traditional domes; each hour displays another<br>
 compelling reason to stay and take more photos. It’s far from the only marvel in Agra, <br>
 the historic city packed with resilient forts, charming mosques, and streets that dance with<br>
 intrigue.<br>
 
 <br><b>3.Cruising the Kerala Backwaters:</b>With more canals than Venice and an equally captivating<br>
 assortment of local gondoliers, the iridescent Kerala backwaters provide one of India’s most<br>
 tranquil excursions. Live aboard house boats, cruise past tiny villages and buffalo ploughed<br>
 rice paddies; the serene waterways are a million miles from the experience in the rest of India.<br>
 Alight and explore a lost temple, then jump back aboard for a sumptuous buffet beneath the stars.<br>
