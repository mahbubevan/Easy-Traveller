   <br>The largest country in Europe and, culturally and historically, one of the most influential<br>
   in the world, France has a reputation that precedes her. Before even visiting, you already <br>
   know about the famous boulevards, the gourmet cuisine, the fabulous fashions and stylish cafes.<br>
   You may have heard the stereotypes, about haughty French waiters, pervasive cigarette smoking<br>
   and smelly cheese. To put the record straight: the waiters are formal rather than friendly, <br>
   smoking is on the decline, and strong cheeses are decidedly optional. France is a country of<br>
   complexities. To truly understand its allure, you have to visit.<br>

  <br>Centuries of history have shaped France’s rich heritage, and the buildings speak volumes:<br>
  from the medieval city of Carcassonne to the Renaissance chateaux of the Loire Valley, and the<br>
  magnificent 19th century Haussmann boulevards in Paris. You can imagine scenes of the Belle Epoque<br>
  at the Moulin Rouge as vividly as World War II battles at Omaha Beach in Normandy. Despite its<br>
  weighty past, France is a thoroughly modern nation. Alongside the ancient castles and cathedrals<br>
  are emphatically 21st century innovations: from the 300 kilometers-per-hour TGV rail service,<br>
  to the Pompidou Center of Modern Art in Paris and a stadium-sized underground cathedral in Lourdes.<br>

  <br>France is defined by its diverse topography. The spectacular landscape ranges from the poppy-strewn<br>
  plains of Picardy to the rolling hills of Champagne, the snowy peaks of the Alps to the serene<br>
  shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Each region has its own unique character. People have different<br>
  accents all over the country, and the gastronomy varies as much as the scenery. President <br>
  Charles de Gaulle once lamented about the difficulty of governing a nation with over 300<br>
  types of cheese – but for visitors, the variety of culture and cuisine is something to relish!<br>
