  Tanzania’s wilderness defies the imagination, its sweeping plains alive with giant<br>
  creatures – and perhaps the closest thing on Earth to a true Garden of Eden. Snowcapped<br>
  Kilimanjaro towers above dusty red savanna, flamingo-carpeted lakes abut thick green<br>
  forests, and lush grass plains seemingly stretch on forever. First-time visitors are<br>
  invariably awed by the scale and color, before being bewitched by the diversity. You’ll<br>
  find hidden waterholes, dazzling white sands, teeming volcanic craters, and ice-capped<br>
  mountain peaks – all within a few hours of each other. These are landscapes that have<br>
  inspired countless wildlife documentaries and Disney movies – evocative spectacles that<br>
  remain indelibly raw and rugged.<br>
  
  <br>No great landscape is complete without an inimitable cast of characters. During the<br>
  great wildebeest migration, an estimated 1.5 million large mammals march across the <br>
  Serengeti, while big cats roam freely through parks and reserves, and spotting hippos<br>
  and elephants is an almost daily routine. No country can match the diversity of Tanzania’s<br>
  national parks and the mind-boggling concentrations of its wildlife. First-timers are always<br>
  wowed, while regulars return year after year because there is always somewhere new to <br>
  explore, something new to see. Safaris in Tanzania aren’t about spotting a few animals<br>
  they’re a sublime immersion in an ancient and astonishing animal world.<br>
  
  <br>Yet peel yourself away from the captivating wildlife, and the landscapes hold countless<br>
  new experiences. Trek up the world’s highest free-standing mountain and stand at 5,895 <br>
  meters on the roof of Africa. Or be lulled into hibernation on the idyllic beaches of the<br>
  mystical Zanzibar Archipelago. And don’t forget one other resident. Tanzanians are famously<br>
  relaxed and friendly – unsurprising, given that they also coined the phrase “Hakuna matata”.<br>
 <br>For all its vast beauty and monumental scale, Tanzania always offers a very personal experience.<br>
 Everybody leaves with different memories, unique snapshots that symbolize their vacation:<br>
 a baby elephant being tenderly mothered, mellifluous taarab music wafting through Zanzibar’s<br>
 Stone Town, a ferocious growl from a black-maned lion, or the incredible procession of wildlife<br>
 wandering past your private veranda. While Tanzania can monopolize superlatives, a trip here is<br>
 always an enthralling journey, full of iconic experiences and surprises.<br>
