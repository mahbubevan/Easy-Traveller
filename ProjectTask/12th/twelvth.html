   <br>Few countries on Earth exert a hold quite like Ireland, where romance, history and <br>
   spirituality suffuse the air, and where the people are always quick to offer a helping hand<br>
   or a timeless bit of native wit. From Celtic myths to the artifacts of early Irish monks, <br>
   to the lives of brave and dedicated patriots, Ireland is a country where stories come alive<br>
   and where adventures are waiting to be made. From the bustling streets of Dublin and the charming<br>
   cafes and chic stores of Belfast, to the windswept wilds of its gorgeous west coast, every<br>
   day in Ireland will make you feel as if you’ve been transported to the land of your dreams.<br>

  <br>There is a charm to the everyday in endearing Eire. Many visitors find their favorite <br>
  activities include walking the streets of a country town or spending an evening sipping Guinness<br>
  and tapping their feet to traditional Irish bands at the local pub. However, Ireland does<br>
  offer a number of notable highlights, and the following places are, simply put, must-sees:<br>
  
  <br>1.Dublin, the social, cultural and political capital of Ireland, is one of the<br>
  great cities in Europe and the home to a wide and diverse array of sights, sounds<br>
  and activities. Gaze upon the magnificent 1,200-year old gospel texts of the Book of<br>
  Kells at Trinity College, enjoy a tour of the world-renowned Guinness factory on the<br>
  banks of the Liffey, or shop ’til you drop at the richly varied stalls and storefronts<br>
  of Grafton Street. However you choose to spend a day in Dublin, you can be sure it will<br>
  unforgettable.<br>
  <br>2.Fronting the pounding Atlantic and marking the western edge of Ireland, the Cliffs<br>
  of Moher in County Clare are among the most dramatic sea-cliffs in the world: a transcendent<br>
  and powerful reminder of the awesome force of nature. The boldest among you will want to <br>
  climb to the top of O’Brien’s Tower, where you’ll be rewarded with sweeping views over Galway<br>
  Bay – and the pulsing surf of the sea pummeling the coast nearly 700 feet below.<br>
  <br>3.Belfast, the vibrant capital of Northern Ireland, is a living testament to the sometimes<br>
  violent, always riveting history of the north of Ireland. Check out the stirring Albert <br>
  Memorial Clock and the ornate and imposing Belfast City Hall, or learn more about the <br>
  city’s distinguished shipbuilding past at the Titanic Belfast museum – a fascinating interactive<br>
  journey ‘aboard’ the world’s most famous passenger ship, on the site of its 1909 construction.<br>
