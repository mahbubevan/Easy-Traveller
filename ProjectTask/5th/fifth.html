   Botswana radiates scale and authenticity, its vast, untamed lands offering a<br>
   dreamt-up version of old world Africa. Road signs warn of crossing elephants,<br>
   rhinos maraud across isolated airstrips, and cacophonous hippo-honks accompany<br>
   every night spent sleeping near water. There are more national parks than major<br>
   roads, and traffic is genuinely halted by herds of 20 elephants crossing the main<br>
   highway. Botswana’s immense landscapes may seem fictional, yet they indelibly <br>
   become real before your eyes. This is an animal kingdom: untouched, unadulterated,<br>
   and unbelievable until you see it firsthand.<br>
   <br>Botswana is a relatively unknown destination, one where instant superlatives <br>
   rarely sit comfortably. As Africa’s most stable democracy and the world’s largest<br>
   diamond producer, the country has been able to develop an exceptional safari<br>
   business – successfully combining high-end luxury with real off-the-beaten-track<br>
   experiences. Boutique lodges stand alone in thousands of square miles of pristine wilderness.<br>
   Huge swathes of the country may never have seen human eyes. Spotting lion prides <br>
   is part of the daily routine, and being on safari starts from the moment you enter<br>
   the country. Botswana is raw, rugged, and relentlessly remote. Reaching its parks<br>
   and camps often requires a short flight: a scenic journey of astonishing vistas <br>
   and prehistoric landscapes. There are no roads, no wifi, and no footprints; this<br>
   is a world where people are just visitors, and quarreling hippos fight before your eyes.<br>
  <br>Let’s indulge a little and consider Botswana’s scale. The Okavango Delta encompasses<br>
  16,000 square kilometers at its flooded height, making it the largest inland water system<br>
  on the planet. Chobe National Park is home to the world’s largest concentration of <br>
  elephants: at least 50,000 of the giant pachyderms roam its great forests and grasslands.<br>
  At 52,800 square kilometers, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve is the world’s second <br>
  largest wildlife reserve, and its original inhabitants, the San Bushmen, are the oldest<br>
  human population in southern Africa – and arguably in the world. <br>
  <br>Explore it all on foot or from a dugout canoe, then watch it all slowly approach from<br>
  your private balcony. The wild game comes so thick and fast that you end up exclaiming and<br>
  pointing whenever another person comes into view. Slowing the heart and calming the senses<br>
  is some of Africa’s finest accommodation: exclusive lodges and lavish tented camps that <br>
  effortlessly blend wild Africa with unmatched luxury. Botswana is the land of animals and<br>
  there are few places on the planet where you will feel more alive. <br>
  
  <br>Botswana is renowned for its progressive conservation policies, with national parks<br>
  and game reserves making up about 38 percent of the country. Their ecosystems merge and<br>
  interact, forming huge swathes of untouched wilderness that define the Botswanan experience.<br>
  Here is a quick south-to-north journey through its most iconic destinations.<br>
