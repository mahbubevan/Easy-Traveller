     Greece is a country renowned for its fascinating history that brought about the beginnings<br>
	 of Western Civilization. Since the ancient Greek ages of war, drama, and art, the country <br>
	 has brought about modern getaways with enchanting perspectives found through unique island<br>
	 formations with whitewashed buildings or Venetian harbors, stunning mountain ranges and<br>
	 distinctive gorges. Medieval monasteries crown precipitous cliffs and Bronze Age frescoes<br>
	 decorate the preserved walls of magnificent palaces. Whether interested in exploring the <br>
	 ancient ruins and archeological sites aplenty or eager to bask in the flickering golden sands<br>
	 of sun-drenched beaches, Greece combines passions of ancient politics, cuisine, and culture <br>
	 with relaxation.<br>

	 <br>Scholars and historians have traced the history of Greeceâ€™s culinary fusion to 350 BC <br>
	 when Alexander the Great extended the empire from Europe east to India, absorbing the influences<br>
	 of the different cultures into the gastronomy. By the 2nd century BC, Greece fell to the<br>
	 Romans, which resulted in a blend of cooking styles and ingredients between Greece and what<br>
	 became the Italian peninsula. Emperor Constantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire to<br>
	 Constantinople in the 4th century AD, which straddled the bridge between Europe and Asia.<br>

   <br>After the Byzantine Empire fell to the Turks, many of the classic dishes took on Turkish names, which<br>
 often remain today. Greeks have influenced many cultures over the course of nearly three millennia,<br>
 and in turn, have also absorbed the likes of the Romans, Venetians, Balkans, Turks, Slavs, and<br>
 also the English. Dishes such as tzatziki and dolmades derive from the Turkish words cacik and<br>
 dolma respectively and can be found in kitchens spanning Armenia to Egypt.<br>

  <br>Common meats in Greece consist of pork, beef, goat, chicken, veal, and rabbit, with the most popular<br>
 item being lamb. Throughout Greek history, meat was only an option for affluent members of <br>
 society, with the less-prosperous members of the community eating meat just once or twice a<br>
 week. Instead of meat, Greeks often utilized grains and pasta, of which they had in abundance.<br>
 The names of foods, cooking methods, and basic ingredients have changed little over the course<br>
 of history, with bread, olives, olive oil, and wine creating a large portion of the diet enjoyed<br>
 for centuries.<br>

 <br><b>Fun Fact:</b> The first cookbook was written by a Greek food gourmet known as Archestratus<br>
 in the 4th century BC, which suggests cooking has always held a significant role in Greek society.<br>
 

<br>Greece is a nation of small farmers that produce a wide array of mostly organically produced<br>
 vegetables, fruits, and cheeses, oils and nuts, grains and legumes. A large selection of greens<br>
 and herbs also grow in the wild in the fertile Mediterranean climate, which also provides <br>
 perfect conditions in which olive and lemon trees thrive. Spices, such as garlic, along with<br>
 herbs like oregano, basil, and mint, have an abundance of uses in Greek cooking to compliment<br>
 common vegetables like eggplant and zucchini. However, many ingredients associated with Greece<br>
 were not introduced to the country until the Middle Ages when European explorers began to trade<br>
 with the Americas to discover potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, and bananas.<br>
