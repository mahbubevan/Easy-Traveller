   <br>Once the most powerful country in the world, Spain basks in the glory of its past.<br>
   The legendary Moorish kingdom of Andalusia was a beacon of civilization during the Middle<br>
   Ages, and the Habsburg dynasty that ruled Spain in the 15th and 16th centuries built an <br>
   empire that extended across Europe to the Americas, Africa and Asia – ensuring that Spanish<br>
   would become the world’s second most spoken native language. Today, Spain’s old superpower<br>
   status and superlative wealth live on in its spectacular historic buildings and monuments –<br>
   and in the vast quantities of gold that still decorate its churches.<br>

  <br>After the Golden Age of the 17th century, Spain began a slow political decline and<br>
  more recently has struggled economically. However, the country’s glorious historic legacy<br>
  makes for an endlessly intriguing visit. With its magnificent monuments, beautiful beaches,<br>
  majestic mountains, and sophisticated social life, Spain enchants millions of visitors <br>
  every year. Many travelers can’t get enough and keep coming back<br>.

  <br>From cosmopolitan Barcelona to romantic Andalusia, Spain is filled with attractions<br>
  that offer a veritable feast for the senses. In every city, you’ll find buildings that<br>
  amaze and inspire: from the immense Gothic cathedral of Seville to the glorious Baroque<br>
  buildings of Madrid, and Barcelona’s breathtaking Sagrada Familia basilica – an epic 130-year<br>
  building project that is finally nearing completion.<br>

  <br>The culinary culture is as rich as it is regionally varied: from exotic tapas and rich<br>
  red wines, to lively food festivals, long lunches, and – of course – afternoon siestas.<br>
  To truly experience Spain, you must adapt to its rhythm and way of life. Adjust to the later<br>
  meal times and take advantage of the nightlife. Learn about the religious festivals and join<br>
  the locals at the piazzas. Sunbathe at the beaches and save time for museum visits. <br>
  Be adventurous and sample the local cuisine, from tangy cold gazpacho soups to whole roast<br>
  suckling pig. Watching a bullfight is a possibility, while chatting with the locals is <br>
  mandatory – and will always make your trip more memorable.<br>
