   <br>Australia really is like nowhere else on Earth. A giant island afloat in the Great Southern<br>
   Ocean, cut off from the rest of the world for millennia, this most ancient of continents has<br>
   long hidden its startling physical beauty and remarkable native wildlife from the rest of the<br>
   world. Inhabited by Aboriginal people who have coexisted with the land for more than 40,000<br>
   years, it was into this pristine wilderness that the British first arrived in 1788. With its<br>
   proximity to the Asian trading routes, and its isolated geography, Australia was the perfect<br>
   penal colony for Britain’s overcrowded shores. For the next 100 years, this beguiling land <br>
   remained the haunt of convicts, explorers and spirited free settlers, who together with growing<br>
   bands of intrepid gold-miners, pearlers, farmers and traders, forged an Australian spirit<br>
   that is characterized by independence, irreverence, and a good dose of humor.<br>

  <br>Despite its transformation from wild hinterland into a sophisticated and glamorous nation,<br>
  the land and the spirit of Australia still have the power to captivate you like nowhere else.<br>
  With a population of only 23 million and a landmass almost the size of America, this is a vast,<br>
  untamed land where you can always find room to get off the beaten track and chance upon the <br>
  unexpected – as well as being peppered for choice in sensational cities like Sydney and Melbourne.<br>
  

 <br>Sip your favorite cocktail as you cruise around Sydney Harbour on a luxury yacht,<br>
 unfurl your swag by a crackling campfire in the Outback, join a gourmet walking tour in Tasmania,<br>
 savor end-of-the-world views from an award-winning eco-lodge, or explore legendary World <br>
 Heritage Sites such as Kakadu National Park, the Ningaloo Coast and Lord Howe Island. <br>
 Journeying through Australia could last a lifetime, but there are a few locations that we’d<br>
 recommend as absolute highlights:<br>
   
   
 <br>1.Dive or snorkel on the Great Barrier Reef, the largest structure on Earth made by living<br>
 organisms, and one of the seven wonders of the natural world. Grab your mask and flippers and<br>
 plunge into the turquoise waters of the world’s largest coral reef system, or just go island-hopping<br>
 around the 900 plus islands with some of the lushest rainforest and purest white sand in the world.<br>

 <br>2.Visit the remarkable island-state of Tasmania, almost half of which is designated as World<br>
 Heritage wilderness. Explore the historic villages and byways which reverberate with Tasmania’s<br>
 penal past, kayak around the pink granite cliffs of the Freycinet Peninsula, discover sparkling<br>
 glacial lakes, and climb the stunning sub-alpine peaks of Cradle Mountain.<br>
 
 <br>3.We’re not the only ones to have an enduring love affair with Sydney; it topped Forbes<br>
 Magazine’s List of Most Reliable Cities in 2013, which rated Sydney’s beauty and safety as top<br>
 notch. Sydney makes the perfect place for the start or end of your Australian adventure.<br>
 Spend a few days in this glorious harborside city, exploring the hidden bays and inlets <br>
 of Sydney Harbour on a luxury yacht, strolling around the historic sandstone terraces of<br>
 Paddington and Woollahra, taking a private surf lesson on Bondi Beach, or walking through<br>
 the many breathtaking harborside national parks at the heart of this lovely city.<br>
  
 <br>4.Raise your glasses in the superb wine-growing regions of Margaret River, in Western<br>
 Australia, and the legendary Barossa Valley in South Australia. Outstanding destinations in<br>
 themselves, Margaret River is famous for its beautiful beaches, distinctive artistic ventures<br>
 and organic food. When visiting Barossa, spend a night strolling down the sandstone avenues <br>
 of Adelaide, one of Australia’s first ‘free settler towns’, and visit Kangaroo Island, an <br>
 enclave of dramatic coastlines and sea lion-ruled beaches. Kangaroo Island not only features<br>
 outstanding wildlife sanctuaries, but these South Australians are serious about their five-star<br>
 accommodation and superb locally-produced cuisine.<br>
