     The richness of Italian civilization incorporates history and heritage through art, architecture,<br>
	 and gastronomy acting as a celebration of culture with unquestionable inimitable style,<br>
	 endless feasts, and sensational landscapes. Sacred sites and medieval villages, lavish<br>
	 churches, and scenery imitating art, the ambiance of Italy derives from a fantastical <br>
	 culture basking in the daily revelries of life, from a simple sip of espresso to the aromas<br>
	 of a slow cooking stew.<br>

<br>Exploring Italy takes you face-to-face with icons of Western Civilization, such as the<br>
 Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, to witnessing expressions of the soul in the works<br>
 of Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, Michelangelo’s David, or Botticelli’s The Birth of<br>
 Venus. Playful baroque fountains grace the public piazzas of Rome, and elegant statuary adorns<br>
 the nave of the Sansevero Chapel in Naples. The trails of the past take you past the Roman<br>
 empire to the Greek settlements of Southern Italy and Sicily or along the famous pilgrimage <br>
 route of Via Francigena, which connected France to Rome during Medieval times.<br>
 <br>Luxury, wonder, and adventure cross paths around the Italy’s more than 116,000 square miles,<br>
 featuring over 4,700 miles of coastline along the Adriatic, Ionian, and Tyrrhenian seas.<br>
 The fascinating preservation of Italy’s past has attributed to the nearly 50 different <br>
 UNESCO World Heritage sites scattered around the Italian peninsula. The diverse landscape and<br>
 captivating wildlife of Italy escape the awareness of visitors interested in nothing more than<br>
 capturing the culture of the main three cities of Rome, Florence, and Venice, however, Italy’s<br>
 treasures go beyond the beauty inside the preserved historical centers of villages, towns, and<br>
 cities across the peninsula by protecting its varied scenery spanning the arid plains and craggy<br>
 gorges of the south, rolling lush hills at the heart of Italy, and snowcapped peaks of the<br>
 Dolomites and Alps in the north.<br>

The remarkable history of civilization in Italy dates back to the 18th century BC, but the history<br>
 of the unified country began in the 1860s during the Risorgimento, during which time Vittorio<br>
 Emanuele II, king of Sardinia liberated the territories of Italy occupied by the French, Spanish,<br>, and Austro-Hungarians. The Republic of Italy is even younger, beginning after World War II<br>
 and the end of Mussolini’s fascist regime.<br>

The aftermath of the Second World War left Italy with a shattered economy and divided society.<br>
 The king, Vittorio Emanuele III, abdicated the throne and the new king, Umberto II, called for<br>
 a Constitutional Referendum, which ended the Italian monarchy by placing a republic in its <br>
 stead by mid-year 1946. The post-war economic growth cooled by the early 1970s and has since<br>
 rebounded only in popular tourist destinations and the industrial cities of the north.<br>
