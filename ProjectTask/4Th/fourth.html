   Kenya’s rich wildlife and immense landscapes are, quite simply, iconic.<br>
   The oft-pictured imagery of an African safari comes to life as you traverse<br>
   the sprawling plains of the Maasai Mara or drive in the legendary shadow of<br>
   Mount Kilimanjaro. The country’s prolific wildlife offers incomparable opportunities<br>
   to observe these magnificent creatures up close in their natural habitats. <br>
   Through our Kenyan partners, we work with some of the country’s top guides to<br>
   ensure that each Kenyan safari experience incorporates as much learning as<br>
   it does observing. In customized open-top 4x4s, these guides will take you<br>
   to some of Kenya’s most remote and untouched corners, providing you with intimate<br>
   wildlife encounters that you’ll often have all to yourself.<br>
   <br>From the sparking beaches of the Indian Ocean through to its vibrant cities,<br>
   and out into the unspoiled bush, Kenya has something special to offer both newcomers<br>
   and older ‘safari hands’.  Here are some of the most iconic and remarkable experiences<br>
   that define a Kenyan safari – whether you’re visiting for the first or the fiftieth time:<br>
  <br><h1>The Maasai Mara National Reserve:</h1> When asked to imagine an African safari,<br>
  you’ll probably picture the plains of the Maasai Mara without even realizing it. Flat-topped<br>
  acacia trees dot vast, rolling grasslands covered with thousands of grazing animals. Lions<br>
  doze in the shade, while zebras nibble at the tall grass just meters away. Enormous herds<br>
  of Cape buffalo with tiny oxpeckers on their backs watch nonchalantly as safari vehicles<br>
  slowly drive past, while giraffes take breaks from browsing to pop their heads out of treetops.<br>
  Driving for hours across this endless, elemental landscape as the sky transforms theatrically<br>
  above you is truly one of the great African experiences.<br>
  <br><h1>The Great Wildebeest Migration:</h1> Going hand in hand with the Maasai Mara is<br>
  inevitably the ‘Great Wildebeest Migration’. Heralded as one of the Earth’s most remarkable<br>
  natural spectacles, this perpetual procession of 1.5 million wildebeest, zebras and antelopes<br>
  is nearly impossible to describe. As thousands of ungulates nervously trundle across the red<br>
  sand and ford the crocodile-infested Mara River, the sound of hooves is almost overpowering.<br>
  When they reach the rolling green hills of the Mara, months are spent feasting on this <br>
  nourishing grass before returning south to the Serengeti. With the great cats and opportunistic<br>
  scavengers escorting the herds for the entire duration, the thrills and excitement of this<br>
  natural phenomenon are positively endless.<br>
  <br><h1>Authentic Maasai Village Tours:</h1> Kenya’s brightly clad and intricately adorned<br>
  Maasai warriors are among the continent’s – and the world’s – most recognizable indigenous<br>
  tribes. These semi-nomadic pastoralists have lived in Kenya and Tanzania since the 17th century<br>
  , including in several areas designated as national parks. The Maasai preserve components of<br>
  their rich tribal culture by sharing their communities, bomas (homesteads), and prized cattle<br>
  herds with tourists. A visit to a Maasai village offers many unique opportunities to learn about<br>
  their vibrant history and ancient beliefs, from boma tours and traditional dance performances,<br>
  to lessons in medicinal plants and bush survival, and wilderness walks with some of the world’s<br>
  wiliest trackers.<br>
  <br><h1>Amboseli National Park:</h1> Among Kenya’s legendary landscapes, few stand taller<br>
  than Amboseli National Park, where impressive herds of the country’s largest elephants <br>
  roam freely against the mighty snow-dome of Mount Kilimanjaro. As the sun rises over ‘the<br>
  roof of Africa’, mothers and their calves drink and bathe in glacial-fed rivers and lakes.<br>
  Large game thrives on these protected plains, creating perfect photo opportunities around <br>
  every corner. The views from the top of Observation Hill have inspired generations of authors,<br>
  painters and conservationists, and sipping a sundowner as the sun sets behind ‘Kili’ is<br>
  nothing short of a transformative experience.<br>
