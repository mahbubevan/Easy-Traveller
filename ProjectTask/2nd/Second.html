  South Africa invariably wows visitors with its unique mix of improbable juxtapositions andbeautiful contradictions.<br>
  It starts with Nature’s beguiling spell. Stark mountain chains rise vertically from whale-ruled oceans; deserts<br>
  and tropical rainforests are separated by slivers of rolling farmland; giant elephant herds wander through<br>
  savanna that overlooks warm Indian Ocean rollers. South Africans themselves provide a marvelous celebration<br>
  of individuality. This is a country with 11 official languages and a national anthem sung in four mother<br>
  tongues. Meeting the locals is integral to the experience and it’s impossible not to be buoyed by their <br>
  boundless resilience and laughter. Even the lion prides and rhinos seem to share this irrepressible enthusiasm.<br>

  <br>At the same time, South Africa is shaped by a remarkable unity, a collective identity that leaves an indelible<br>
  mark on all who visit. From the moment you step off the plane, you know you’re in the ‘Rainbow Nation’. Friendly<br>
  welcomes are unanimous and universal, regardless of the language. The diverse geography provides endless magic:<br>
  from the hippo-infested swamps of the Limpopo, to the soaring snowcapped peaks of the Drakensburg, and dozens of<br>
  sun-drenched beaches tucked away on the country’s 2000-mile coastline. Even its cities can harmoniously package<br>
  everything together – epitomized by Cape Town, one of the most singularly spectacular destinations on the planet.<br>

  <br>Explore the Garden Route, a bewitching stretch of coastline that offers never-ending changes of scenery and<br>
  perpetual surprises. Mystical forests tower over serene beaches, the Big Five roam in private reserves, arid<br>
  desert is flanked by towering mountains, and coastal heathlands are dominated by the vibrantly-hued fynbos that<br>
  constitute the smallest and richest of the world’s floral kingdoms. The Garden Route is South Africa in a<br>
  nutshell, an enchanting journey through ever-changing landscapes, which is always relaxed and benevolently easygoing.<br>
  South Africa’s rugged coastline is a clash of styles: brutal Atlantic waves merging with warm, unruffled Indian Ocean<br>
  waters. Transcending the competing currents is a collection of the world’s largest marine animals. Three different<br>
  whale species can be found breaching just meters from the Hermanus Cliffs; you can go on a boat trip to see the <br>
  magnificent southern right whales at breathtakingly close range. Whale sharks – the peaceful plankton-eaters<br>
  that grow up to 12 meters long – roam the waters near St Lucia, while formidable great white sharks can be<br>
  seen from an underwater cage in Gansbaai. Fortunately the sharks aren’t everywhere, and safely dotted around <br>
  the 2000-mile coastline are numerous famous surfing spots.<br>
  Take a day trip down the Cape Peninsula, meandering along cliffside roads that often defy engineering.<br>
  Stop to sunbathe on fine white beaches, swim with the fearless penguins at Boulders Beach, have a meal<br>
  in a quaint fishing village, and admire the stunning views over the South Atlantic from a succession of lookouts.<br>
  Your final destination is the very southwestern tip of Africa: a jagged range of rock, sand, and a fairytale lighthouse.<br>
  Set sail from here and the next stop would be Antarctica. Just think about that for a moment. <br>
