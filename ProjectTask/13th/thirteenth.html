   <br>Croatia's tones are warm and rich; the colors of summer cascade all year round.<br>
   The eye wanders across monochromic orange roof tiles to untrammeled beaches, on wards<br>
   to benevolent waters and along to forests of pine. Each initial panorama is a postcard,<br>
   a frame of Mediterranean bliss tucked into a blossoming corner of Eastern Europe. <br>
   But ravishing as she may be, Croatia's allure is not merely one of aesthetics. <br>
   Sentiments of old-world charm are inescapable, whether you're sipping fruit wine at<br>
   waterfront restaurants, lounging in World Heritage towns, or feeling soft sand beneath<br>
   bare feet. A quaint mystery radiates throughout, tumbling down from hilltop ruins to <br>
   cobblestone Venetian streets. While Croatia has blossomed as a modern nation within the<br>
   European Union, it retains an atmosphere of exoticism.<br>

  <br>A thousand tales of Croatian history are etched into the old walled towns that dot<br>
  the coast. These start in ancient Rome and continue through four centuries of Venetian rule.<br>
  More recently, Croatia has the flavors of Ottoman elegance and the remnants of its part in<br>
  former Yugoslavia. Consistent throughout these chronicles is Croatia's role as an up-market<br>
  tourist destination. Ever since Roman emperors and star-crossed Venetian lovers escaped here,<br>
  the country has always rewarded indulgent tastes and aspirations for exclusivity; untrammeled<br>
  Dalmatian islands offer a getaway beneath balmy skies, forest walkways open onto veiled <br>
  waterfalls, private yachts lull in deserted bays, and boutique guesthouse terraces gaze<br>
  down on 14th century stone staircases. An atmosphere of splendor wraps everything in a <br>
  blanket of romance, the panoramas soft on the eyes and the destinations reveling in impressions<br>
  of escapism.<br>

 <br>Inimitability is rooted in the country's rich history and geographical location.<br>
 Croatia is a centerpiece of paradigms; its expressive identity is a blur of Mediterranean<br>
 reverie, ancient Europe, and Eastern elegance. Then there's a kaleidoscope of distinct local<br>
 flavors that have flourished since the country's independence in 1991. And while the luxury <br>
 treatment may suggest otherwise, this is still an emerging and relatively undiscovered tourist<br>
 destination. You get the intrepid feeling of exploring somewhere new, with the reassuring ease<br>
 of being in modern Europe. Croatia stands in the top echelons of enchanting world destinations;<br>
 except it remains off most radars. Here is an opportunity to immerse yourself in somewhere <br>
 delectably unspoiled:<br>
   
   
 <br><b>1.The historic grandeur of Dubrovnik:</b>The grandest of the country's ancient <br>
 walled cities, World Heritage Dubrovnik, towers over sapphire waters with its streets of<br>
 eternal seduction. Fortressed walls look down on sloped tiles, boutiques emerge down softly<br>
 illuminated alleys, and city squares are wrapped in the chatter from al fresco terraces.<br>
 Fully pedestrianized and carefully preserved, Dubrovnik is a 15th century Adriatic wonder<br>
 that few people want to leave.<br>
  <br><b>2.Sailing the Adriatic in a private yacht:</b>Cruising Mediterranean waters in a <br>
  private yacht is one of Europe's most iconic experiences. Historic wooden vessels offer the<br>
  elegance of sailing, your yacht propelled by wind power as an evocative coastline gently<br>
  rolls past. Modern motorized yachts cruise at a faster speed, allowing you to tour all the<br>
  eclectic treasures of Croatia's Adriatic coastline. In recent years, Croatia has emerged as<br>
  Europe's premier destination for private sailing trips, the coastline offering dozens of <br>
  potential routes; dock in secluded bays, explore tiny coastal villages, and snorkel below<br>
  the sheets of turquoise.<br>
  <br><b>3.The splendor of Plitvice Lakes:</b>Cascading through lush forests, the Plitvice Lakes<br>
  are a symbol of Croatia's inland beauty. A series of wooden walkways and platforms take you<br>
  through the park, running alongside limestone formations, transparent rivers, and mystically<br>
  cloaked waterfalls. Hemmed in by green, Plitvice is an explosion of grace and color. It's just<br>
  one of many Croatian national parks.<br>
