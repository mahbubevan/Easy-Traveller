   <h1>The Journey</h1><br>
   It should come as little surprise that the etymology of safari comes from Swahili.<br>
   Dependent on where you are in East Africa, safari is a direct translation for “journey”<br> or “long journey.” This is a fitting metaphor for thinking of African safari as a vacation.<br>
   Considering a safari in terms of must-see sights and check lists reduces it to any other<br> sightseeing vacation, while thinking of it as an immersive journey into a vast unspoiled <br>
   world helps to evoke the inimitably of the experience.Many new travel experiences can<br>
   be easy to preconceive; an iconic European city,the next tropical beach destination,<br>
   an ancient Asian empire. While the destinations may be foreign, there's enough in the<br>
   name to picture part of the experience. African safariignites a whole host of competing<br>
   images, each struggling for believability. Wildlife documentaries and animated movies help<br>
   create idealized scenes, but trusting them as markers often seems farfetched. A thousand<br>
   analogies about untamed animal kingdoms sound evocative, yet what does that really mean? <br>
   Most of the animals can be found inhabiting zoos all across the world; so is safari that <br>
   much different? While the remote often unimaginable exoticism of African safari is part <br>
   of the seduction, it's also a huge part of the inhibition.<br>
   Traveling to Africa can be daunting. It's a continent that often defies the imagination;<br>
   one immersed in wild images of safari and natural spectacle, yet one that also comes with<br>
   negative misunderstood clichés. These pages are designed to provide quick, practical<br>
   information for anyone planning a trip to Africa, including details about visa formalities,<br>
   what to pack, accessing your money, and pre-trip healthcare considerations. They are <br>
   designed to smooth out some of the misconceptions and ensure you're ready for the adventure.<br>
    <h1> Visiting Africa Isn't That Complicated</h1>
   Landing in Africa can be surprising. There's often a shock as people discover that there<br>
   aren't lions on the international airport runway or taxis-sidestepping elephants to reach<br>
   the terminal door. Yes, Africa can be a wild place, a place where iconic mammals roam freely,<br>
   and their evocative calls can be heard through the night. But the whole of Africa isn't one<br>
   big savannah. The continent is relatively well developed, something that becomes the next<br>
   surprise on most visitors' first day in Africa. Roads are tarred, hotels are luxurious,<br>
   and there is an irrefutable sense of moving forward. Even in the first few hours, there's<br>
   an unmistakable feeling that this is a place striving towards the future. It's a feeling<br>
   that's shared regardless of the country or city you arrive in.<br>

   Many people arrive in Africa with a few unresolved anxieties. These might be about safety,<br>
   health, whether the itinerary will run smoothly, or what will happen in an emergency. This<br>
   apprehension is usually the reason many people don't visit Africa. So many people treasure <br>
   the dream of visiting Africa, yet only a fraction of these end up visiting. There's a <br>
   phantom unease that floats around whenever the words Africa and travel are tagged together.<br>
   This ghost of anxiety makes the landing in Africa so relaxing. Many have prepared<br>
   themselves – mentally and in their physical preparation – to be met by the negative<br>
   connotations associated with Africa. Then they arrive and realize that their fears <br>
   were mostly popular misconceptions.<br><br>

  Stress melts away, and the continent quickly pulls you into a spell of enchantment and<br>
  surprise. It is an eye-opening experience, just in a different way to most people imagine.<br>
  So many hours and days may have gone into preparing and over-preparing for a trip. Africa <br>
  isn't that much different to visiting any other continent on the world. Preparing for an<br>
  African safari is much the same as preparing for any other vacation. Yes, there are some<br>
  specifics around health and some information to check around visas, but this isn't a<br>
  distant planet requiring oxygen masks and moon-boots. While this is something that<br>
  doesn't necessarily sound believable now, it's something that makes those first few<br>
  hours on the continent a wonderful blend of unwinding disbelief.<br> <br>
  Even for the most dedicated safari aficionados, safari is both a diverse and <br>
  all-encompassing term, one that isn't encapsulated in a single moment. Every day<br>
  brings a thousand new scenes, each one potentially epitomizing the experience, yet<br>
  simultaneously blending into the overarching impression. For the first time <br>
  visitors, it’s important to start with the basics. Safari is not like being in<br>
  a zoo, just like Paris's Louvre is nothing like visiting a high school art gallery.<br>
  One features animals and the other features art, but that's where the similarities end.<br>
  African safari is about animals in their natural habitat; born in the wild, raised in <br>
  the wild, and seeking survival in nature's cycle of life. It's easy to recognize<br>
  that there's a difference between a leopard in a cage and a leopard roaming across <br>
  iconic bushland. Understanding the difference builds a picture of why African safari is so special.<br>
  <br>
  There's a thrilling intimacy to exploring the wild, proximity and exclusivity ensuring<br>
  that every moment is delivered in kaleidoscopic high definition. Perhaps the leopard is<br>
  searching for food, its hunting instincts the pinnacle of an omnipresent wildlife<br>
  interaction that plays out across a phenomenal scale. Many African safari destinations<br>
  dwarf US states or European countries in size. And none of them are tamed. Rather than<br>
  being on the outside looking in, a safari places you on the inside, offering immersion<br>
  into nature's theater and its perpetual drama and charm. You don’t just have front row<br>
  seats; you're on the stage. Quickly turn around and there's an elephant herd with trunk<br>
  swinging babies leading the march. Safari is also defined by diversity; every angle is<br>
  new, every day brings an eclectic concoction of scenes, every park offers something <br>
  unique, and everyone's experience will be different, even if they're following the same itinerary.<br>
  <h1> Intimacy</h1>
  A lion's mane flowing in the breeze, the fearful guise of a zebra herd, the melancholy<br>
  smile of an old elephant bull cast out from the herd; head out on safari and there's an<br>
  irrevocable intimacy to every scene. Animals reveal their full character in the wild,<br>
  redolent eyes and ever-changing expressions always on display. There's often a shared<br>
  glance, eyes briefly meeting as those on four legs recognize those on two. Some <br>
  wildlife is always intrigued, maintaining the stare or coming closer; like a lion<br>
  pride inspecting the safari truck. Some wildlife will skip off to hidden havens,<br>
  while whole herds will stop and stare, considering their next move. Stop, stay silent,<br>
  prove you're not a threat, and the intimacy levels increase.<br><br>
  Intimacy is partly stimulated by proximity. In an unfenced landscape there is often no<br>
  limit to the closeness; turn a corner and a dozen giraffe cover the track, wake each<br>
  morning to grazing ungulates beside camp, and stay quiet as a buffalo herd marches to<br>
  within meters of your eyes. There are no barriers and such proximity brings an undeniable<br>
  thrill. Intimacy also stems from the authenticity of what is being revealed. Wild animals<br>
  are far more expressive than tamed ones and the wild African hinterlands are filled with<br>
  characters, each with their emotions on full display. Mothers gently protecting calves,<br>
  young males battling for supremacy and mating rights, babies tentatively becoming accustomed<br>
  to the landscape they inhabit; these are moments that can define the safari experience, <br>
  fleeting glances that linger in the memory or played-out dramas providing two hours of entertainment.<br>
  <h1>Scale</h1>
  Safari quickly leaves impressions on a micro level, individual moments providing the <br>
  resonant snapshots of life in the wild. But safari is also about scale. Take the <br>
  Serengeti as an example; it's bigger than the Netherlands, but there are other game<br>
  reserves in Tanzania that are four times that size. Four US States could fit into <br>
  the area covered by Botswana's Central Kalahari Game Reserve. If the Kavango-Zambezi<br>
  Transfrontier Conservation Area  was a country, it would easily rank within the 30<br>
  largest in the world. It's actually spread across five African nations. Such scale<br>
  is perpetually inspiring, both conceptually and during the safari. For example, <br>
  seeing a few elephants is always memorable. Driving for a day and witnessing thousands<br>
  upon thousands of elephants is a new experience entirely.<br>
  <br>As the hours roll into days, the safari experience starts to leave lasting impressions<br>
  of this scale. This is not about seeing a few animals. Initially, it's the abundance of<br>
  mammals and birds that begins to offer dazzling impression of scale. Even in the smallest<br>
  of parks and reserves, each day will bring new herds, new battles, and something that's<br>
  been hiding away until now. Even after a few days there will be a new sight to discover.<br>
  Micro scenes build upon micro scenes and the macro begins to take shape, the whole experience<br>
  is elevated when you consider that the scenes are repeating themselves over such an immense area.<br>
